Basic Font Information

Aubrey is a playful condensed decorative font with an art nouveau essence.
Horizontal elements are unexpectedly cut and swapped with 
sloped curves creating off-beats in the overall rhythm.
Spurs are added to twist and stress the movement.
Aubrey can be a good choice for designing holiday
decorations and greetings. Works best in medium and large sizes.
